✨ Hello, I am Melanie and I’ll talk a little bit about myself. ✨

Since 2015, I've worked on diverse projects, from front-end to back-end development and systems integration, specializing in APIs using IBM Integration Bus, APP Connect and Oracle SOA Suite.

With 9 years of experience (almost 10), I’m continuously learning new and "old" technologies. I’m a curious, self-taught professional, excited to contribute to the community and always looking for challenges to solve creatively and efficiently.
