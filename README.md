✨ Hello, I am Melanie and I’ll talk a little bit about myself. ✨

My first degree was in biology, an area I worked for a few years until I decided to switch to IT. The initial (at the
time, also the principal) reason for this change was due to opportunities in the Brazilian market, which
unfortunately does not value biology professional.

I started my second degree in IT, specifically the bachelor degree in Information Systems, and ended up
identifying myself so much with this new area and with the amount of opportunities to learn new things and
improve myself that I embraced it and specialize in the following years, managing to work in large companies
and in good projects, thereby gaining a good professional experience.

I graduated in 2017, but I was already in the IT market since 2015, when I started with the internship program,
and ended being hired full time.

This year I am going to 9th year of IT experience, and during this time I have been through different projects,
involving different technologies, from front-end to back-end programming, as well as data and systems
integration, to which I have specialized in the last 2 years, Creating API Soap and Rest using the tools IBM
Integration Bus and Oracle SOA Suite (Jdeveloper and Eclipse). I have experience with ETL demands using tools
such as Microsoft Power BI, Pentaho and IBM InfoSphere DataStage, as well as some courses in these areas.

Especially last year, in addition to the courses I took to improve my work at the company I am currently in, I am
also curious and I am always looking for courses on other technologies to be able to understand the
technological environment as a whole, and in fact I see how it usually makes a difference in my daily work.

Recently, I briefly participated in a project dealing with NodeJs and I really liked it. I already had contact with
Javascript, as well as CSS and HTLM, and I was very excited to know more about it and I can say that today I am
a javascript enthusiast, taking advantage of the time I have at home to learn more about this technology.

I am a very passionate person to learn new things, with great learning facility and self-taught.
Responsible, creative, dynamic, and organized person who always seeks to adapt to different environments and
has a great desire to learn. You can expect honesty, commitment, and willingness to work from me. I have
experience in teamwork and good ability to communicate.

I also enjoy challenges in which I try to use my skills to find the best solutions to solve problems as simply and
intuitively as possible.
